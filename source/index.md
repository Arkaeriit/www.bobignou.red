## What to find here
On this blog I mainly speak about DevOps or programming related subjects that touch too many part of a system to be included in a git repository.

If you want to see nicer things I made, I should redirect you to my [Github](https://github.com/Arkaeriit).

## Other services
On this server, you can also find a [Cyberlander text board](https://cyberland.bobignou.red).

I also host my [personal Git server](https://git.bobignou.red).

If you want some fun, you could always type the command:
```shell
ssh -p 2244 snake@bobignou.red
```
