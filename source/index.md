<h1> Hello! <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width = 30px> Welcome to Bobignou.red!</h1>

## What to find here 
On this blog, I mainly speak about tech related subjects that touch too many parts of a system to be included in a git repository. 
 
If you want to see the nicer things I made, I should redirect you to my [Github](https://github.com/Arkaeriit). 
 
## Other services 
I have included some other fun stuff on this site including:

- A [Cyberlander text board](https://cyberland.bobignou.red) for discussions.
- A [personal Git server](https://git.bobignou.red) which hosts my projects.
- A fun command line game, just type the following command in your terminal: `ssh snake@bobignou.red`.
- A Gemini capsule of this blog, find it at `gemini.bobignou.red` and `bobignou.red`.
