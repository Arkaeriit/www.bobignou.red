## What to find here 
On this blog, I mainly speak about tech related subjects that touch too many parts of a system to be included in a git repository. 
 
If you want to see the nicer things I made, I should redirect you to my [Github](https://github.com/Arkaeriit). 
 
## Other services 
On this server, you can also find a [Cyberlander text board](https://cyberland.bobignou.red). 
 
I also host my [personal Git server](https://git.bobignou.red). 
 
If you want some fun, you could always type the command: 
```shell 
ssh snake@bobignou.red 
``` 
 
If you prefer Gemini over the web, you can find this blog as a Gemini capsule at the URLs `gemini.bobignou.red` and `bobignou.red`.
