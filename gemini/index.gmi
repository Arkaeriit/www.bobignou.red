## What to find here

On this gemlog, I mainly speak about DevOps or programming-related subjects that touch too many parts of a system to be included in a git repository. 

If you want to see the nicer things I made, I should redirect you to my Github.

=> https://github.com/Arkaeriit github.com/Arkaeriit

## Other services

On this server, you can also find a Cyberlander text board.

=> https://cyberland.bobignou.red cyberland.bobignou.red

I also host my personal Git server.

=> https://git.bobignou.red git.bobignou.red

If you want some fun, you could always type the command:

```
ssh snake@bobignou.red
```
