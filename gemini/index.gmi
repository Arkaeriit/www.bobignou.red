## What to find here

On this blog I mainly speak about DevOps or programming related subjects that touch too many part of a system to be included in a git repository.

If you want to see nicer things I made, I should redirect you to my Github[4].

=> https://github.com/Arkaeriit 4: github.com/Arkaeriit

## Other services

On this server, you can also find a Cyberlander text board[5].

=> https://cyberland.bobignou.red 5: cyberland.bobignou.red

I also host my personal Git server[6].

=> https://git.bobignou.red 6: git.bobignou.red

If you want some fun, you could always type the command:

```
ssh -p 2244 snake@bobignou.red
```
